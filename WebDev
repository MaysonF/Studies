Introduction: 

  # The Internet - Global network of interconnected computers that communicate via TCP/IP. Network of Networks
  # The Web - The World Wide Web is an information system where documents and other resources are available over the internet
    > Documents are transferred via HTTP
      + "Hyper Text Transfer Protocol"
      + Foundation of communication on the WWW
      + Request - I would like infomation please, Response - OK, here ya go!
        @Ex: Refreshing webpage will transfer request to website server which will respond with output from website server and browser will display response to user
        @Client - The computer that accesses a server (the requestor)
   
The Request/Response Cycle:

  # Server responses to request with instructions that browser can understand/render for human understanding 
  # Source code (or the instructions) are a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript  
  
Front-End and Back-End:

  # Front-End - Focuses on what runs on a browser (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
  # Back-End - Focuses on server side and compiling information based on request (Java, C, C++, Python)
  
What do HTML/CSS/JS do?

  # HTML - nouns (what)
  # CSS - adjectives (describe)
  # JS - verbs (action)
  
Introduction to HTML:

  # HTML is a "mark-up language"
  # The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993
  # To write HTML, we pick from a set of standard elements that all browsers recognize
    > Common elements include:
      + <p> element - represents a paragraph of text
      + <h1> element - represents the main header on a page
      + <img> element - embeds an image
      + <form> element - represents a form
   # We create elements by writing tags 
    > MOST elements consist of opening and closing tagss
      + ex: <p> I am a paragraph </p>

HTML Elements:

  # <b></b> - bold word or phrase
  # <p></p> - defining a paragraph or related context
  # <h1></h1> - Main heading
  # <h2></h2> - sub-heading
    > Cannot have an h2 without and h1
  # <h3></h3> - even smaller heading
    > Cannot have an h3 without and h2
  # <h4></h4> - smol boi
    > Cannot have an h4 without and h3
  # <h5></h5> - smoler boi
    > Cannot have an h5 without and h4
  # <h6></h6> - smolst boi
    > Cannot have an h6 without and h5
  # <html></html> - Standard html formatting
  # <head></head> - Header
  # <title></title> - Title (browser tab name)
  # <body></body> - Overall information 
  # <ul></ul> - unordered list (bulleted)
  # <li></li> - single item in a list
  # <ol></ol> - ordered list (numbered)
  # Can NEST lists
    > ex: <ul>
            <li> Farm Animals </li>
              <ul>
                <li> Cow </li>
                <li> Sheep </li>
                <li> Pig </li>
              </ul>
            <li> House Animals </li>
              <ul>
                <li> Dog </li>
                <li> Cat </li>
                <li> Fish </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
  # <a href= "http://www.google.com"></a> - anchor tags 
    > creates hyperlink to go to another webpage
    > needs attribute to be useable: href (hypertext reference)
  # <img src="download.jfif"> - image embed element
